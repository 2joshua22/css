<!-- The transition CSS property is a shorthand property for transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay.Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element. Different states may be defined using pseudo-classes like :hover or :active or dynamically set using JavaScript. -->

<!-- The transition-property CSS property sets the CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied. -->

<!-- The transition-duration CSS property sets the length of time a transition animation should take to complete. By default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur. -->

<!-- The transition-timing-function CSS property sets how intermediate values are calculated for CSS properties being affected by a transition effect. -->

<!-- The transition-delay CSS property specifies the duration to wait before starting a property's transition effect when its value changes. -->
